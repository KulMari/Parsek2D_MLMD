MaxwellianTest1 tests:
-- with centered grid, playing with the ratio, the superposition of refined grid and coarse grid core boundaries
-- with shifted grid, the projection for MP/PM/PP areas

rerun when projection is modified


SmallReconnection: 
reconnection test from thesis (not the big, recent one)
Check conserved quantities when modifying the code. Use the same configuration.
Different runs (1,2,3,4) with same input and configuration show early differences in E (OK, very low values), the other quantities are more stable. Grid1 starts diverging in the different runs earlier than grid0.
